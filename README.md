# Trail Runner 2.0
## A boot-loader for a local-first web.

This project creates a gateway to an Automerge-powered, local-first web. It allows your browser to load data out of Automerge documents as though they were stored on web servers using nothing but service-worker configured to fetch from the sync-server of your choice.

## A Tour

The basic idea here is that we use JSPM to look up what libraries a piece of code uses (app.js), then we calculate the dependencies using a Generator, fetch the dependencies and make them into automerge docs, and last store an importMap pointing to them for future use.

If you run the app with `?shouldRebuild` in the HREF, you'll trigger recompilation of the importMap. Initial setup is slow because I think I've pushed a bunch of junk data into the starting document.

### index.html

This file includes a static importMap generated by the JSPM CLI with a few tweaks to refer to the vendored versions of the JSPM libraries and Automerge, as well as importing `es-module-shims`.

The `es-module-shims` library is a fast polyfill for providing importMap support to browsers that lack it. In our case, we're also taking advantage of its ability to load new importMaps at runtime.

The changes to the JSPM libraries are just to support WASM loading, and the changes to Automerge are to support JSPM. The former, at least, I expect to fixed in the next upstream release.

Aside from creating an environment where we can use JSPM, it also loads `index.js` and `app.js` in that order.

### index.js

This file creates a generator, then looks inside the next file (app.js) to decide what libraries it will need and fetches and inlines them into automerge. (It doesn't do this if it already has an importMap and you haven't asked to regenerate it via the URL.)
